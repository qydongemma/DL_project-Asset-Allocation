# PROJECT - Asset Allocation with Deep Learning
This is a term (Spring 2019) project based on course IEOR4720 Deep Learning taught by Prof. Ali Hirsa at Columbia Univeristy. Many thanks to Prof. Ali Hirsa and Mr. Ted Lockwood who had provided detailed practical guidence and valuable suggestions on this project. 

## Project Preview
This project is about exploring the application of deep learning techniques in asset allocation optimization. We applied Long-short-term-memory (LSTM) neural networks to estimate the best allocation weight for each asset. Particulaly, we built a backtest dataset by simulating highly realistic correlated asset returns, and compared portfolio performance based on traditional Mean-variance Optimization (MVO) strategy, with portfolio perfomance based on strategy using LSTM predicted weights.
