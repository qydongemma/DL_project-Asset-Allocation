# PROJECT - Asset Allocation with LSTM 
This is a term (Spring 2019) project based on course Deep Learning taught by Prof. Ali Hirsa at Columbia Univeristy.

## Project Preview
This project is about exploring the application of deep learning techniques in asset allocation optimization. We applied Long-short-term-memory (LSTM) neural networks to estimate the best allocation weight for each asset. Particulaly, we built a backtest dataset by simulating highly realistic correlated asset returns, and compared portfolio performance based on traditional Mean-variance Optimization (MVO) strategy, with portfolio perfomance based on strategy using LSTM predicted weights.
